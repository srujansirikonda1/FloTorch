# FloTorch Installation guide


Welcome to FloTorch! This guide will help you set up FloTorch's infrastructure on AWS. There are two approaches for setting up and we will guide you through the steps.

Irrespective of the approach, below are the pre-requisites:


### 1. AWS Account and Tools

### Approach #1: AWS Cloudformation Template 

Before starting the installation, please subscribe to FloTorch:

1. Visit the [FloTorch AWS Marketplace page](https://aws.amazon.com/marketplace/pp/prodview-z5zcvloh7l3ky?ref_=aws-mp-console-subscription-detail-payg)
2. Click on the "View Purchase options" button
3. After subscribing, click on 'Continue to Configuration'
4. Select your preferred fulfillment option and Software Version


Post subscribing, please click this link: [Install FloTorch (US East 1)](https://us-east-1.console.aws.amazon.com/cloudformation/home?region=us-east-1#/stacks/create?stackName=flotorch-stack&templateURL=https://flotorch-public.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/2.1.0/templates/master-template.yaml)

### Approach #2: Command Line Installation

Please ensure the following pre-requisites are met:

1. Python 3.9+
2. AWS CLI configured
3. docker installed and running

## Installation Steps

1. Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/FissionAI/FloTorch.git
cd FloTorch
```

2. Make the provision script executable:
```bash
chmod +x provision.sh
```

3. Run the provision script:
```bash
./provision.sh
```

## Configuration Steps

When you run the provision script, it will first check if there are any existing environments. If there are, you'll be asked if you want to create a new environment or update an existing one.

For a new environment, or if no existing environments are found, the script will prompt you for the following information:

### 1. AWS Marketplace Subscription
- Answer `yes` if you have an active subscription to FloTorch on AWS Marketplace
- Answer `no` if you haven't subscribed (this will build and push Docker images)

```bash
Subscribed to FloTorch on AWS Marketplace? (yes/no):
```

### 2. OpenSearch Configuration
- Choose whether you need OpenSearch for your deployment
- Default: `yes`

```bash
Do you need OpenSearch? (yes/no) [yes]:
```

### 3. Stack Parameters
- Project Name: Used as your CloudFormation stack name. Must be unique within your AWS account
- Default: `flotorch`

```bash
Enter project name [flotorch]:
```

- Table Suffix: Used to create resources with unique suffix
- Must be exactly 6 lowercase letters

```bash
Enter Table suffix (exactly 6 lowercase letters):
```

- Client/Organization Name: Your organization or team name used for resource tagging
- Must be 3-20 lowercase letters, numbers, or hyphens
- Default: `flotorch`

```bash
Enter client/organization name [flotorch]:
```

### 4. OpenSearch Configuration (if enabled)
- OpenSearch Admin Username
- Default: `admin`

```bash
Enter OpenSearch admin username [admin]:
```

- OpenSearch Admin Password
- Must be 8-41 characters with at least one letter, one number, and one special character

```bash
Enter OpenSearch admin password:
```

### 5. NGINX Authentication
- NGINX Password for accessing the FloTorch App
- Must be 8-41 characters with at least one letter, one number, and one special character

```bash
Enter NGINX password:
```

### 6. AWS Region
- Choose AWS region for deployment
- Default: `us-east-1`

```bash
Enter AWS region [us-east-1]:
```

## Environment Management

The script automatically saves your configuration to a JSON file in the `.envs` directory. This allows you to:
1. Create multiple environments with different configurations
2. Update existing environments without re-entering all parameters
3. Keep track of your deployments

When updating an existing environment:
- The script will show current values in brackets
- Press Enter to keep the current value, or type a new value
- Table suffix cannot be changed during an update

## Deployment

The script will:
1. Create a CloudFormation stack with your project name
2. Build Docker Images in your local and pushes to ECR, if there is no marketplace subscription.
3. Deploy all necessary resources
4. Output the AppRunner URL when complete

To monitor the deployment:
```bash
aws cloudformation describe-stack-events --stack-name YOUR_PROJECT_NAME
```

## Post-Installation

After successful deployment, you'll receive:
1. AppRunner URL for making requests
2. OpenSearch endpoint (if enabled)
3. Monitoring dashboard URL

Store these URLs securely for future use.

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. Stack Creation Failed
   - Check CloudFormation events in AWS Console
   - Verify your AWS CLI has sufficient permissions

2. Resource Limits
   - Ensure your AWS account has sufficient service quotas
   - Request limit increases if needed

3. Issues for AWS Marketplace Subscription Users
   - Verify your subscription status in AWS Marketplace
   - Ensure your subscription is active and properly configured

## Cleanup

To remove all deployed resources:
```bash
aws cloudformation delete-stack --stack-name YOUR_PROJECT_NAME
```
